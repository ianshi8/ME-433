# ME-433
Repository for Northwestern's ME 433 Advanced Mechatronics Coursework (Spring Quarter, 2023)

This is an advanced class in mechatronic systems prototyping. In this course we learned how to design, solder, and debug a printed circuit board (PCB) and create physical prototypes with a laser cutter and 3d printer. We also learned advanced digital communication protocols like SPI and I2C, and advanced signal processing. 

The following repository contains the various assignments completed in this course.
